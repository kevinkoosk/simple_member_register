# simple_member_register

Wordpress plugin to register a new member

## Explanation

1. Registration Form: The display_registration_form function outputs a simple HTML form for username and email.
2. Form Submission Handling: When the form is submitted, it triggers the process_registration_form function. This function sanitizes the input and prepares a PayPal button for payment.
3. PayPal Integration: The form includes hidden fields and directs the user to PayPal for payment. Replace YOUR_BUTTON_ID with the ID you get from your PayPal button configuration.
4. Payment Confirmation: After the payment, PayPal can redirect back to a specific URL on your site (you set this in the PayPal button settings), where you handle the registration logic in handle_paypal_return.

## Next Steps

1. Replace "YOUR_BUTTON_ID" with your actual PayPal hosted button ID.
2. Configure your PayPal button to redirect back to your site with query parameters (e.g., ?paypal=return) for handling the registration post-payment.
3. Make sure to add server-side validation and error handling for production use.
4. Always use HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.
5. This setup provides a basic integration. For a live environment, you'll need to handle more complex scenarios, including payment failures, refund processing, and securing data transfers with SSL.
